***How it works***
You donâ€™t need to use any database for this project. There will be a simple webpage that will submit the form to the server and get the converted value back and display it on the webpage.

Unit Converter

You can have 3 webpages for each type of unit conversion (length, weight, temperature) with forms to input the value and select the units to convert from and to. Submitting a form will submit the data to the current page (i.e. target="_self") and display the converted value. You can do this using the backend programming language of your choice i.e. check if the form is submitted and then calculate the converted value and display it on the webpage, if not submitted then display the form.
